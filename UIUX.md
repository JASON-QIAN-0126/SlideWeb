## First, i made lot of Interaction Design.
Every interactive features will change when you hover and click.
For slide card in dashboard, each will zoom when mouse hover.
For each button, each will not only zoom but have color change when mouse hover and different function button have different color performance(cancel and confirm button show different).
When select Thumbnail or rearrange slides, each slide you choose will be highlighted around,
and if slides number is large, it can scroll to view all.

## Second, i have clear layout and navigation design.
Landpage,dashboard and slide page all have clear Navigation Bar to help user quick and easy
to find the function they needed. Similar functions are placed in the same bar and the bar is typeset according to functional requirements.

## Third, i made good color plan.
The whole project used same color style(purple) and helpful function is highlighted by color difference(pink, light purple,blue..) which make the interface visually beautiful and in line with barrier-free design principles
Additionally, when a modal is openned, the background behind the modal will darken to highlight the modal.

## Fourth, in order to have good performance on different devices, i made many adaptations.
Title text and buttons have different style adjustments for different screen sizes.Functions layout are also optimized for different devices. For example, the update background module, the selection history module, the editing window, etc. are all optimized according to different device sizes.

## Fifth, i made lots of guidance, tips and feedbacks.
For login and register part, it will show clearly which error is like "Already Registered","Wrong password", "No internet connection".. For slide part, each confirm modal will warn you whether to confirm your action. And each add, change, edit modal have clearly guidance text on it.
Also, i got Loading and progress indicators, sometimes a presentation is large and takes time to open, it will show loading on page.
