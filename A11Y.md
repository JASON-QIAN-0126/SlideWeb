## I made clear labels in jsx instead of div
I made labels like "EditButtonBar","SlidePageControl".. to make readers better understand content structure.

## I made Focus indicator.
When the mouse is pointed at each interactive element, there will be a color and size prompt to tell the user which target is currently selected.

## Made alt description
Picture, video, thumbnail all have alt, so when it unable to display, users can see what it should be in text.

## Clear color plan
I made clear color plan, ensure clarity between text and background. Also have color change when user
hover button to show their focus and different function button(cancel, confirm) have different color.
Also when a modal is openned, the background behind the modal will darken to highlight the modal.

**Clarify on thumbnail(2.2.1, 2.2.2)** 
My design on thumbnail is that when creating a presentation, thumbnail will be set default as slide 1.
Users can choose slide they like as thumbnail in presentation, when thumbnail slide is deleted,
thumbnail will shown as grey in dashboard(Satisfy 2.2.2).
